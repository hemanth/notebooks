            "The code is generally correct but has some issues. It does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the PIL Image.open and image.save functions. Also, the filename is extracted from the image URL, which may not always be the best approach, especially if the URL does not contain a valid filename.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Performance Optimization Opportunities: \n",
            "The code sends two GET requests, one to the XKCD API and another to the image URL. This could be optimized by using a more efficient method to download the image, such as using the requests library's streaming functionality to avoid loading the entire image into memory.\n",

            "3. Documentation Quality: \n",
            "The code has a docstring for the function, which is good. However, it could be improved by adding more details, such as the parameters the function takes, the return values, and any exceptions that may be raised.\n",

            "4. Type Hint Usage: \n",
            "The function has a return type hint, which is good. However, it is missing type hints for any potential exceptions that may be raised.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Edge Cases Handling: \n",
            "The code does not handle edge cases well. For example, it does not check if the image URL is valid or if the image can be opened by PIL. It also does not handle the case where the XKCD API returns an error or the image cannot be saved.\n",
